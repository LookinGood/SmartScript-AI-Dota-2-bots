Modified AI based on Valve's default scripts. My first work with LUA.

Recommended difficulty: Hard/Unfair
Supported game modes: 
All Pick
Turbo
Single Draft
Least Played
Newbie Mode

Note: If bots have stopped/are not using an ability/item correctly, the problem is most likely that Valve changed the way they use it, but didn't add the right command for LUA implementation - like “alternate use”.
